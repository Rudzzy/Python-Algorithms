# 🧠 Python Algorithms

Welcome to my personal vault of **Python algorithms** – built for speed, structure, and serious interview prep. This isn’t just another DSA dump. It's a **well-organized, carefully curated** collection of problems that matter – the kind that get asked at real companies and dominate platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and more.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I’m building this as a long-term reference to:
- 📌 Track and master frequently asked problems
- 📦 Keep reusable, clean solutions handy for any coding round
- 📚 Deepen my understanding of algorithmic patterns
- 🧩 Spot repeatable tricks used by top coders
